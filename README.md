# Weather-App
This project was completed for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Javascript Weather App Assignment.  

The aim of this project is to make an app that gets data from [The Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

## Built With

* Search for other info besides city name
* Further styling
